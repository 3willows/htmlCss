  <h1>Cuttlefish</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>
    Cuttlefish, or cuttles, are marine molluscs of the order Sepiida. They belong to the class Cephalopoda which also
    includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone, which is used
    for control of buoyancy.

  <h2>Taxonomy and etymology</h2>
  <p>
    Cuttlefish have large, W-shaped pupils, eight arms, and two tentacles furnished with denticulated suckers, with
    which they secure their prey. They generally range in size from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in), with the largest species,
    the giant cuttlefish (Sepia apama), reaching 50 cm (20 in) in mantle length and over 10.5 kg (23 lb) in mass.[2]

  <h2>Fossil record</h2>
  <p>
    Cuttlefish eat small molluscs, crabs, shrimp, fish, octopus, worms, and other cuttlefish. Their predators include
    dolphins, larger fish (including sharks), seals, seabirds, humans, and other cuttlefish. The typical life expectancy
    of a cuttlefish is about 1â€“2 years. Studies are said to indicate cuttlefish to be among the most intelligent
    invertebrates.[3] Cuttlefish also have one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of all invertebrates.[3]

  <h2>Range and habita</h2>
  <p>
    The Greco-Roman world valued the cuttlefish as a source of the unique brown pigment the creature releases from its
    siphon when it is alarmed. The word for it in both Greek and Latin, sepia, now refers to the reddish-brown color
    sepia in English.
